# Forest Fire Detection
This project is a machine learning-based approach to detect forest fires using image processing techniques. It uses color, texture, and edge features of the images to train a classifier that can predict whether the input image contains fire or not.

 ## How to Run
1. Download the Forest Fire Dataset from www.kaggle.com/datasets/alik05/forest-fire-dataset and extract the contents to a folder named "Forest_Fire_Dataset".

2. Install the required dependencies, including OpenCV, NumPy, PIL, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and others.

3. Save the code in a Python file, and run it using a Python interpreter.

4. The output will be stored in a text file named "results.txt".

Note: The script assumes that the dataset is organized in a particular way, with separate folders for training and testing data. It also assumes that the images are in JPG format.

## Dependencies
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* PIL
* scikit-image
* scikit-learn
## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to detect forest fires in real-time, which can help prevent damage to natural resources and property. The code was developed by Leo Sipowicz as a demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.
